# Tasker Rocket 🚀
The repository for Tasker Rocket 🚀, aka the new Tasker application.
This project aims to be a smart front-end for the Tasker-Rocket-content repository.
<br> The content repository is responsible for providing the content.

## Installation
The installation is quite simple, just prepare the `.env` file, 
run `npm install` and `npm run dev` and you are good to go.

First, copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values. 
You might need to create a GitHub access token to be able to use this app.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then install the dependencies of our project:
```bash
npm install
```

After installing the packages you can now run the app:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Updates
It's important to keep our dependencies up to date, so packages 
should be updated regularly using the instructions below.

### Minor-updates
Minor-updates can be performed by using the command of below:
```bash
npm update
```

### Major-updates
Performing major-updates is a bit trickier, first identify the outdated dependencies.
```bash
npm outdated
```

Then update each package one-by-one by reinstalling it
```bash
npm install <packagename>@latest
```

#### Upgrade all packages at once
It can be quite cumbersome to upgrade each package manually, 
the `npm-check-updates`-package can do this for us.

##### Usage
Show all new dependencies ([excluding peerDependencies](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/issues/951)) for the project in the current directory:

```bash
$ npx npm-check-updates --peer
